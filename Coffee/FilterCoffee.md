Also called *pour-over*.

Pour over coffee brewing involves pouring hot water over coffee grounds. Gravity drains the water through the grounds, out the bottom of the cone, and into the mug.

It has some differences from drip coffee:
 - water is heated in a separate kettle
 - water is poured manually, allowing for finer control
