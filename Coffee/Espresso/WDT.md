# Weiss Distribution Technique

The Weiss Distribution Technique (WDT) is a distribution method for espresso making. Using a fine needle or similar tool, the barista stirs the coffee while it sits in the portafilter. A funnel placed above the portafilter helps prevent spills. The stirring action breaks up any clumps, and evens out the density of coffee within the puck.

The result is reduced [[Channelling|channelling]], and higher, more even extractions.
