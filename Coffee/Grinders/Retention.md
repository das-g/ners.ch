# Retention

Retention is measured by how much old coffee is retained in the grinder. This is typically stuck in the grinding chamber, chute, or various nooks and crannies of the device.

High retention is a problem since it means that there will be some “exchange” every time you grind. In other words, it means that you might get a bit of old coffee out into your portafilter.
