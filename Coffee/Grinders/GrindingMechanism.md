# Grinding mechanism

## Blade

Blade grinders work like blenders, slicing coffee beans into small granules.

- Tend to be cheaper than burrs
- Least uniform grind size

## Burrs

Burr grinders capture beans between rotating serrated surfaces.
The beans are crushed under pressure.

- Overall more uniform grind size
- Can be adjusted more precisely

### Conical burrs

- Cheaper than flat burr grinders
- More bimodal grind distribution

### Flat burrs

- The most uniform and consistent grind distribution
- More expensive
- Can run noisier and hotter when grinding large amounts
- Can have problems with [[Retention|retention]], which is usually mitigated by bellows or installing them at an angle

### Burr material

- Ceramic is sharper and retains its edge better, but can break
- Steel is overall more durable
- Steel generates more heat if grinding large amounts
