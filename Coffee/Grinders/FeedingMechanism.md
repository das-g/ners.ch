# Feeding mechanism

## Hopper

Hopper-fed grinders hold a large quantity of coffee beans.

- The coffee in the hopper can go stale.
- It can be hard to dose an exact amount, as they mostly dose by time rather than weight.

## Single dose

Single dose grinders don't hold any beans, and must be manually fed for every extraction.

- More work for each coffee cup prepared.
- The dose can be as precise as you like.
- Allows for additional prep steps, e.g. [[RDT]]
