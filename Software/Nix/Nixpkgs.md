Nixpkgs is a Git repository hosted on GitHub.

It contains:
 - a large collection of software that can be built with [[Nix]]
 - the implementation of [[NixOS]]
 - a canonical library of Nix functions (sometimes called "Nix' standard library")

It is not the only source of Nix software and libraries, but it is the most commonly-used one.
